## Updating Term Information

At the start of each new term, please update the following settings in `src/predefined.py` to reflect the current term's projects and capacities:

- `projects`: A list of projects for the term.
- `capacities`: The maximum number of people allowed in each project.
- `demand`: The minimum number of people required for each project.

These settings are crucial for ensuring the algorithm correctly assigns participants to projects according to the updated term requirements.
