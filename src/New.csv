While getting to know the general team-centered design process, I hope to learn in-depth about markup and styling using HTML and CSS, and how to add interactive elements with JavaScript, frameworks like Flask, and APIs. I think it would be especially interesting to explore these within the context of sustainability and how to convey information about relevant projects using these languages, especially since working in sustainability is one of my biggest career goals as an engineer!","worstWebsite: amazon.ca - Maybe not the worst, but it always looks very cluttered and it's pretty hard to find specific information",,,,,,,
